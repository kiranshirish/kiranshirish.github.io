                <p>I specialize in biomechanics and medical devices, with a passion for robotics and neuroengineering.
                    For two years, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Passerini Lab at UC Davis,
                    where I designed laminar flow chambers for atherosclerosis research. I also interned at Exact Sciences,
                    where I got more exerience with rapid prototyping and liquid handling robots. In my free time, I love to work out, cook, 
                    and spend time outdoors.

                    <p>
                        My team and I worked with orthopedic surgeons and prosthesists at the UC Davis Medical
                        center to develop an orthotic device that restores elbow function to brachaial plexus injury
                        patients. We are utilized a gas strut to provide lifting assistance and locking capabilities
                        in order to keep the device lightweight and ergonomic. My team is in the picture above!

                    <h3>Laminar Flow Chamber - Passerini Lab</h3>
                    <p>
                        To replicate the laminar flow our endothelial cells experience in our blood vessels,
                        I designed a flow chamber with parallel plates to subject cultured cells to ideal
                        flow conditions. The gap height is 250 microns, just over two human hairs in width! These 
                        chambers were manufactured with SLA 3D printing and CNC milling.

                    <p> My team and I designed a pill splitter for patients with neuropathy and partial blindess.
                        We were one of 3 out of 15 teams selected to move forward to the prototyping stage in this 
                        48 hour design competition hosted by BMES. Our prototype was capable of splitting pills of 
                        all shapes and sizes, and we won the Most Creative Prototype award for our device.

                    <p> Liquid handling systems such as the Hamilton are incredibly efficient, but prone 
                        to error. I designed these camera mounts to slide into the
                        machine, allowing service engineers to monitor the machines and diagnose failures
                         with minimal interference to the clinical scientist team.

                        to watch the KingFisher centrifuges. These were designed to be cheap,
                        lightweight, and to keep the camera out of the way of clinical scientists.

                        can be sterilized in the autoclave, traps bubbles effectively, and can stack securely with 
                        other reservoirs through a dovetail joint.</p>

                        desk for people in wheelchairs to use as they went about their daily activities.
                        The desk would be stowed under the seat when not in use, and would be able to be
                        quickly deployed with one arm. We took home the Most Creative Design award at this 
                        competition.
